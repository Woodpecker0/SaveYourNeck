1,Since the face width and eyes distance maybe different from everyone or different laptop, if users can pre-set parameters through gui, it would be better.

2,The angle between camera(screen) and eyes should be detected to prevent neckache (neck pain caused by wrong reading pose.)

3,The time of using computer can be recorded to remaind the user whether they should have a rest.
